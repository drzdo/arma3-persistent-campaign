Basically, the **effects from previous mission are moved to the next mission**. By effects I mean:

- vehicles (positions, damage, inventory, fuel, textures, flags)
- crates/boxes (positions, damage, inventory, arsenal)
- planted mines (positions)
- players (positions, loadout, ACE medical)
- all map markers
- ACE rallypoint position
- ACE trenches, ACE Fortify statics, any buildings placed by Zeus (technically, almost any static which are considered "Things" in Arma)
- ruined buildings, fences, trees
