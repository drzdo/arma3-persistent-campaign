ROS_AI_Revive system v4.0 - by RickOShay

LEGAL STUFF: You may use these scripts in your mission - full attribution must given on Steam Workshp submission and in your mission.
Likewise if you modify any / all of these scripts or use them in derivative work - attribution must be given in the Steam Workshop submission as well as in the new script and your mission.

USAGE:
This system works for all units on the player's side or in the player's group see scope below.
NOTE: ALL PLAYERS MUST BE ON THE SAME SIDE.
The leader of the group must be a player.
You must have some AI units on your side or in your group for it to work.
NB! Vanilla revive system must be enabled for SP and MP.

Ace is not explicitly supported but this script apparently does work with it.

INSTALLATION:
1. Copy the ROS_AI_revive folder to your mission root.
2. Add the sound classes to CFGSounds in your description.ext (See sample description.ext file in Example root files folder)
3. Put the following line in your init.sqf:
[] execvm "ROS_AI_revive\scripts\ROS_monitorhealth.sqf";
4. Create a text file in the mission root called: initserver.sqf Place the following code into that file:
   (This will stop AI respawning when killed)

{
	_x addMPEventHandler ["MPRespawn", {
		params ["_unit"];
		if (!isPlayer _unit) exitWith {
			deleteVehicle _unit
		}
	}]
} forEach playableUnits;

Please see the ROS_monitorhealth.sqf script header in the ROS_AI_Revive\scripts folder for more details on usage and some additional options.

Designed to work with BIS revive system for players in MP.
If you have problems please contact me on Steam.

Cheers

ROS
