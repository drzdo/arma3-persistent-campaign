Ver 4.0
A major improvement to performance and reliability. 
Autorecover is now on by default - AI that are incapacitated will auto recover after 5 mins if they arent revivedduring that time. This feature can be toggeled off - see ROS_monitorhealth.sqf header for options. The medic reassignment process has been totally rewritten. AI medics now have 15 secs + travel time (running speed) - to respond - failing that the medic and incap unit will be removed from the processing queue and reset and a new AI will then be assigned to revive the unit.  
Overall AI responsiveness and FPS/server load is significantly better (~20 fps gain).
